## General Information

This repository contains our blog site, Nook, a clean and focused space that puts the users and their content back into focus and puts the rest aside! Using Nook, users can view other user posts, comment on the post and/or react to the post. Users can easily create their own content with images, edit content or delete content. Users can also easily manage their profile if they forget their password or want to change their password.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap CSS Framework
- Feather Icons Library
- Node.js
